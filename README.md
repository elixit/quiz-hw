## Project function
- the goal of this project is to implement a start button which triggers a timer. Once the timer starts, the user will be prompted two questions. If they miss a question, the correct answer will be displayed below. If they finish the quiz or lose, the bottom half of the page will display their score. Each time a user misses a question, the timer will deduct seconds.
